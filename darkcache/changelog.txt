Added text output confirming setting changes.
Added special text explanations with setting confirmations where appropriate.
Reworked all caching toggles (except Mourningstar since it works differently) to simply rebuild the relevant cache when a related setting is changed. They should all work now.

# 1.2.2
Fixed issue where an error would be shown if player started game with all caches but hub caching disabled and then went to buy something from the credits store.
Fixed issue where toggling a cache would not take effect due to related cache not being rebuilt.
Added a bit more text to hub caching explanation indicating that (currently) the cache won't be disabled properly until player restarts client.
Changed all the ModNexus filenames back to just "DarkCache" so things work better for Vortex users. Sorry you guys for this last change.
Reworked settings so caches aren't rebuilt at character change when no mod settings have changed.

Fixed incompatibilty issue with the CharWallets mod where incorrect contracts info was displayed.
