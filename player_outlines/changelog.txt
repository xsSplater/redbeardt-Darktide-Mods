# 1.2
- Refactored code to make it simpler.
- Integrated zh-cn localisation (deluxghost's PR).
- Added settings caching (performance).
- Added interval to PlayerUnitOutlineExtension update hook to make it a little more performant.
- (Hopefully) fixed console log spam that occurred sometimes when reloading mods.
